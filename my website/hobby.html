i love reading books in evening  my relation with books is same as your with your best frnd might be i read books because it gives me a 
chance to observe a world  , Books have the power to improve your vocabulary by introducing you to new words. The more you read, the more
your vocabulary grows, along with your ability to effectively communicate. Additionally, reading improves writing skills by helping the
reader understand and learn different writing styles

My opinion is that cooking is the best hobby to have, because it can be very useful in life. Cooking is my hobby and has been for several
years. I was about five years old, when I started learning how to cook. Cooking is something that I inherited from my grandmother; my 
grandmother was a professional chef and owned her own restaurant, where I learned how to cook. so whenever i have free time  i love  
cooking or baking its always gaves me a  pleasure and  relxation
